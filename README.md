## Introduction
- to optimize an algorithm you need to make assumptions
- a slow performing algorithm is preferable to a fast one that doesn't work
- algorithms can have different best case and worst case performance times
- the worst-case is often the deciding factor

## String algorithms
- one way of searching for a specific letter is to search for it in lowercase and then in uppercase. An alternative is 
to convert the string to all lowercase and then search for it in lowercase form. This is called normalizing
- another option is to limit the input by validation
